Come come everybody
Gather in a canteen
Food for your eyes
Food for your soul
Food for the girls
I want it
I want it all
I've changed my mind I wanna rock
That Vivienne Westwood
Gucci, Prada and Dior
Mind's on my money
And money's on my mind
Late to the party
Nice to meet ya home
Pleasure's mine
